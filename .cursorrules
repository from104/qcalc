**Extremely Important!!**
When generating or modifying code, *never* omit any part of the code, no matter how long it is. Omissions can lead to the code failing to function as intended or cause critical errors. **Do not omit anything under any circumstances.**

**Top Priorities for Code Generation**
1. Ensure a linear dependency structure whenever possible.
2. Build a structure that facilitates seamless maintenance.
3. Write the code, including comments, in a way that makes its intent and logic **easily understandable** and interpretable by anyone.
4. Design the code with a **clear and simple structure**, prioritizing reusability for future purposes.
5. Make sure the code is clean and easy to understand.
6. Make sure the code is optimized for performance.
7. Make sure the code is secure.
8. Make sure the code is scalable.
9. Make sure the code is easy to maintain.
10. Make sure the code is easy to debug.
