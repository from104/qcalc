- **Extended Color Theme System**: Added the ability to choose from various color themes beyond dark/light mode, providing a personalized UI experience.

### Changed

- **Help and Tips Document Update**: Updated help and tips documents including detailed usage and shortcut information for each calculator mode (Standard, Unit Conversion, Currency, Radix) and key functions.
- **Changed the way to copy or paste panel content**: Instead of copying by clicking (touching) the panel or pasting by long-pressing, you now open a menu by clicking (touching) (or right-clicking) the panel and select the desired action from the menu.
- **Percentage calculation shortcut expansion**: Added the `%` key as a shortcut for the percentage calculation function, in addition to the existing `k` key.

### Fixed
